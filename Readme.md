# Get Mail

This plugin / simple code allows you to send mail when something happens in your app. This is like an introduction to begineers to the world of backend development.

For now it takes email as input and sends them an mail with more info and link to this source code. You can also customize it if you have the email address you want to send the mail to. More on this is coming soon and authentication is in progress so that people can only send mail to their own email address. 

In an upcoming update, you will be able to send various mails and test it and change it on the website. On the final click you will get the mail on the button you have selected. 

This is similar to way the companies use it like for example, 

1. When you change password of some account or websites. 
2. When you login or logout of Netflix. 
3. When a vercel / netlify deployment is failed (that's for me only). 

Etc. You get the idea.

If you loved this simple idea, please give it a star ‚≠ê and share it with your friends.
